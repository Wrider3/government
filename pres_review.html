		<h3>The Cabinet</h3>
		<p> The president surrounds himself with executive heads of departments and other key advisors, whom the president has to inform and aid him in decisionmaking. There are three major styles of presidential staffing: competitive, where power is overlapping, and competing opinions, so that the president may hear all sides with integrity and then make decisions. Another style is a hierarchical model with clear lines of authority. The final model is a collegial style that allows all top level staffers access to the president in an immersive, group style approach.</p>

		<h3>The Power of Persuasion</h3>
		<p>The presidential power is the power to persuade. The president is not just a list of powers, but an individual with characteristics and flaws. Their character, confidence, intelligence, etc. all play a factor. Ability to bargain, deal with adversaries, and choosing priorities separate presidents who are mediocre from the legends. Presidents gauge their success with the people based upon their public approval ratings and can use the public response to override the opinions of their cabinet and advisors.
